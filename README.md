## News-App

This web-app is powered by newsapi.org/ which is an API developed to serve news w.r.t different queries.

## About this app

This app gives you a choice between 3 countries India, USA and Germany namely to facilitate your preference of Area/Region for delivering the news. The choice you make is stored locally in your browser so as to save you from selecting the country again and again. Moreover, you can always change your region preferences just by tapping a single button.

## Usage

I would've had attached a working link here but since newsapi.org responds with Error426 (which is an error related to upgradation of protocols), I'd tell you a way out. 

All you've got to do is: 

1. Clone this repository.

2. Copy it into 'htdocs' (a sub-folder present in the folder of XAMPP server).

3. Turn on Apache server and open localhost in your browser.

4. Navigate over this folder and Hurry! We've made this work locally.

Also, if you feel it's too much of work to do, you can just glance through demostration video to understand the working of the project.
